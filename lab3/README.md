This lab required exploring new programming languages and utilizing imperative programming. I chose Rust and Go as the languages to use; In order to learn them, I implemented a simple game of “rock,paper,scissors” using imperative programming.

**How to run things:**

First make sure to install dependencies (Rust and Go lang, check their official websites on how to properly install them on your machine).
Rust-

cd rock-rust

*cargo build*

*./target/debug/rock*

Go-

cd rock-go

go build

./main

**Use:**
This is a simple CLI game. You are asked to choose between rock, paper, or scissor. The CPU picks a random choice, and after three games a winner is determined.
