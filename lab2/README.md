### Each file contains the solution for each question.
**q1.py:** Reads from a CSV file. We read from public data to find out how many projects each borough has. We read from the csv file located in this directory.

*Expected output*: list of boroughs with number of projects they contain.

**q2.cpp:** We convert from fahrenheit to celsius with 7 static data points.

*Expected output*: List of numbers with their conversions.

**q3.sh:** We do a CURL request to the NASA datapoint. We store the API key inside a txt file. Therefore, create the file and store your API key inside there.

*Expected output*: JSON content with API returned data.

### To run each program:

**q1.py:** *python3 q1.py*

**q2.cpp:** *clang++ -std=c++11 q2.cpp -o q*

*./q*

**q3.sh:** First change permissions for the file (shown inside the comments). Then run it: *./q3.sh*
